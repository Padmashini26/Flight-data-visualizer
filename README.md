# ✈️ Flight Data Visualizer

A simple Python project to visualize simulated flight data such as altitude, speed, and pressure over time.  
Great for practicing data visualization and post-processing, inspired by real-world aviation use cases.

## 📂 Files
- `flight_data.csv`: simulated flight data for 60 minutes
- `visualize_flight_data.py`: script to load data and generate line plots
- `Alt_tim`, `speed_time.png`, `cbnpress_time.png`: chart outputs

## ▶️ How to Use
1. Make sure you have `matplotlib` and `pandas` installed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas
